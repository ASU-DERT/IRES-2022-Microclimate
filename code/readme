This is a list of code files and their contents for the 2022 IRES Microclimate project. 

Kestrel_compilation.qmd:
This file works up Kestrel data from the 2022 IRES Microclimate project, microphase 1 and 2. Original Kestrel csv files (L0 data) are pulled in, annotated, cleaned, and saved as a L1 file. This file can be pulled in for future analyses (start at L1 section).  Note that exact locations where Kestrels were deployed are currently not known.

litter_WHC_trail.qmd:
This code works up data, creates plots, and analyzes data from the litter water holding capacity (WHC) trial. 

Microphase1_iButtons.qmd: 
This file works up iButton data from the 2022 IRES Microclimate project, microphase 1. Original iButton csv files (L0 data) are pulled in, annotated, cleaned, and saved as a L1 file. The L1 file can be pulled in for future analyses (start at L1 section).
To do: work up L1 timeseries data by logger and treatment.

Microphase2_iButtons.qmd: 
This file works up iButton data from the 2022 IRES Microclimate project, microphase 2. Original iButton csv files (L0 data) are pulled in, annotated, cleaned, and saved as a L1 file. The L1 file can be pulled in for future analyses (start at L1 section).
To do: work up L1 timeseries data by logger and treatment.

microphase2_litter.R
	- pulls in the microphase2 leaf mass data (microphase2.csv).
	- plots  litter moisture by collection time (separate line for burial depth)
	- This is very similar to Fig 3B

microphases1and2.qmd
- pulls in the microphase1 leaf mass data and cleans it
- plots microphase1 leaf mass data relative to species and litter conditions (NOT USED for ms) and rainfall treatment


weather_compilation.qmd
- pull in the Gobabeb weather for microphase1 (Gobabebmet_phase1.csv)
- plot humidity and fog versus time
- plot soil and air temporature versus time
- pull in the Gobabeb and Aussininas weather for microphase2 (gobabeb-auss-microphase2.csv)
- compare Gobabeb and Aussininas weather data for microphase2
- replace missing Gobabeb data with Aussininas data where appropriate
- plot humidity and fog versus time
- plot soil and air temporature versus time

R SCRIPT FILES THAT ARE NOW IN AN ARCHIVE FOLDER (zARCHIVD)
ibuttons_phase1_plots.R: reads in iButton data for phase 1 project (data file is Microphase1_iButtons_ALL_dt.csv, which 
  has a manually added date-time column -- note that this is largely redundant with "Microphase1_iButton_compilation.R" that 
  pulls together individual csv files). Calculates mean values for temperature for each species x condition x time 
  interval. Plots a graph that is essentially Fig 2B (similar formatting) but without the fog times and ambient 
  temperature. 
    2025-07-03 HT assessment - seems to be out of date
Microphase1_littermoisture.R: This file works up litter moisture data for microphase 1. microphase1.R appears to be more recent and complete code.

microphase1_litter.R:
	- This pulls the leaf water content data for microphase1 (microphase1.csv)
	- Data are plotted as Figure 2A (formatting nearly similar, although fog period is not plotting properly)
