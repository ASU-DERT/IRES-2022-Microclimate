This is a list of code files and their contents for the 2022 IRES Microclimate project. 


FILES EXISTING IN REPO SET UP BY SIEN:
ibuttons_phase1_plots.R: reads in iButton data for phase 1 project (data file is Microphase1_iButtons_ALL_dt.csv, which 
  has a manually added date-time column -- note that this is largely redundant with "Microphase1_iButton_compilation.R" that 
  pulls together individual csv files). Calculates mean values for temperature for each species x condition x time 
  interval. Plots a graph that is essentially Fig 2B (similar formatting) but without the fog times and ambient 
  temperature. 
    2025-07-03 HT assessment - seems to be out of date, both in terms of using the manually added date-time column and
    the 

Microphase1_iButton_compilation.R: 
  - imports the leaf mass data for microphase 1
  - graphs leaf moisture data over time - this is essentially Fig 2A but formatted differently
  - reads in iButton and compiles iButton data for microphase 1 from the folder where it is stored 
      (data/Microphase1.iButtons)
  - creates poorly formatted facetted plots with temperature and moisture
     2025-07-03 HT assessment - figures are out of date but the initial iButton data pulling and reformatting for time appears to be good

microphase1.R:
	- This pulls the leaf water content data for microphase1 (microphase1.csv)
	- Data are plotted as Figure 2A (formatting nearly similar, although fog period is not plotting properly)

microphase2.R
	- pulls in the microphase2 leaf mass data (microphase2.csv).
	- plots  litter moisture by collection time (separate line for burial depth)
	- This is very similar to Fig 3B
	
weather_phase1.R
- pull in the Gobabeb weather for microphase1 (Gobabebmet_phase1.csv)
- appears to plot humidity and fog versus time, although there are issues with the code (seems to be an attempt at 2 y-axes that didn't quite do the trick)

weather_phase2.R
- pull in the Gobabeb and Aussininas weather for microphase2 (gobabeb-auss-microphase2.csv)
- appears to plot humidity and fog versus time, although there are issues with the code (seems to be an attempt at 2 y-axes that didn't quite do the trick)
- Data are in wide format but columns for Aussininais and Gobabeb data not properly called. Neeed to do do some comparisons and decide how to use Aus data for missing Gobabeb data.
