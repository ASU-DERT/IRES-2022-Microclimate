This folder contains data from the 2022 IRES Microclimate Group. All files in this folder are the final versions of data that are being used for analyses. 

Files in this folder are:

litter_WHC.csv - This file contains all data used to determine leaf water holding capacity in the lab experiment. Variables are: Species	LitterCond	Type	Bag_ID	Bag_Mass	TargetMass	MassT0noBag	MassT1wBag	MassT2wBag	LitterDryMasswBag

microphase1_gobabebmet.csv  - This file contains data from Gobabeb Met weather station from the SASSCAL web site. Data cover the period of the microphase1 experiment (7/23/22 1:00 to 7/26/22 7:00). Variables are:StationName	StationID	Date	Time	Datetime	Hour	Minute	AirTemperature	SoilTemp	Rain	Fog	WindSpeed	WindDirection	WindSpeed_Max	Humidity

Microphase1_iButtons_L1.csv - This file is a compilation of all the iButton data from the microphase1 ibuttons. Data have been cleaned (in Microphase1_iButtons.qmd) to be only during the experiment period. There are 37367 logs. elapsed_time is calculated as the time since the start of the experiment. Variables are: date	time	unit	temperature	condition	species	quadrat	loggertype	Rainfall	datetime	elapsed_time

microphase1_Kestrels_L1.csv - This file contains data from the Kestrel loggers deployed during the microphase1 experiment. Data have been cleaned (in Kestrel_compilation.qmd) to be only during the experiment period. There are 3614 logs. elapsed_time is calculated as the time since the start of the experiment. Variables are: datetime	temperature	RH	HeatIndex	DewPoint	DataType	KestrelID	loggertype	elapsed_time
Note that we don't currently have locations for Kestrels, so these data may not be useful.

microphase1_litter_data.csv
Data are the leaf mass data and associated variable information collected for the microphase1 experiment.
Variables are: Species,Littercond,TYPE,Plot,Rainfall,Bag_mass1,Bag_mass2,Interval,Sample_mass,SandMasswBag,D_bagMasswSand,Drymasswbag,Date,Time,Cond_spec,Datetime

microphase2_gobabeb-auss.csv - This file contains data from both Gobabeb Met and Aussininas weather stations from the SASSCAL web site. Data cover the period of the microphase2 experiment (7/30/22 1:00 to 8/1/22 6:00). The Gobabeb station was offline for about half of the day on 7/31, so the Aussininas data can be used to replace Gobabeb during that time. Variables are: Date	Hour	Datetime	Station	AirTemp	SoilTemp	Fog	WindSpeed	Humidity

Microphase2_iButtons_L1.csv - This file is a compilation of all the iButton data from the microphase2 ibuttons. Data have been cleaned (in Microphase2_iButtons.qmd) to be only during the experiment period. There are 35709 logs. elapsed_time is calculated as the time since the start of the experiment. Variables are: date	time	temperature	depth	quadrat	loggertype	rainfall	datetime	elapsed_time

microphase2_Kestrels_L1.csv - This file contains data from the Kestrel loggers deployed during the microphase2 experiment. Data have been cleaned (in Kestrel_compilation.qmd) to be only during the experiment period. There are 2619 logs. elapsed_time is calculated as the time since the start of the experiment. Variables are: datetime	temperature	RH	HeatIndex	DewPoint	DataType	KestrelID	loggertype	elapsed_time
Note that we don't currently have locations for Kestrels, so these data may not be useful.

microphase2_litter_data.csv
Data are the leaf mass data and associated variable information collected for the microphase2 experiment. Varibales are: Label,DEPTH,Plot,Rainfall,Interval,Sample_mass,SandMasswBag,Dryingbagmass,Drymasswbag,D_bagMasswSand,DrySandMass,TotalBagwSandMass,Date,Time,Datetime,Wmass,Dmass,Moist

Sub-folders in this folder contain L0 data that was used for L0 data compilation. These should no longer need to be used. Folders are:
Microphase1.iButtons
This folder contains individual csv files for each iButton logger deployed during microphase1.
Files names are the litter type (B or G), species (SP or SS), and location (Q1-9)

Microphase2.iButtons
This folder contains individual csv files for each iButton logger deployed during microphase2.
Files names are the depth (D0, D1, D3)  and location (Q1-15)

KestrelData.L0
This folder contains individual csv files for each Kestrel logger deployed during microphase1 and microphase2. We currently seem to be missing inforamtion about where Kestrels were deployed. Data may or may not be useable.
